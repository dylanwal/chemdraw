Improvements to add:
3) grid single figure
4) grid handles a list of configs or list of molecules
6) gif construct atom
7) grid- subplots
8) mutation gif

Room for improvement:
1) highlight atoms and bonds 
   1) smooth out and fix overlaps
2) draw bonds so atom symbols don't need white background; then allow background to be transparent
